# GenAI Shop – E-Commerce Web App

## 🛍️ Overview
GenAI Shop is a modern, single-page e-commerce web app built with React (via CDN), Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Animate.css. The project was originally provided as a broken/incomplete codebase and has been extensively fixed, completed, and enhanced using a combination of AI tools and manual development.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🛠️ Fix and complete a broken web development project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally a framework (React).
- 🐞 Resolve major bugs, incomplete features, and design issues in the provided codebase.
- 💎 Enhance UI/UX and ensure cross-device responsiveness.
- 🤖 Use AI tools to assist in debugging, generating code, or optimizing logic and design.
- 🧩 Ensure clean, modular, and maintainable code structure.
- 📝 Document all fixes, enhancements, and AI-generated contributions.
- 🌟 Optional: Add new features or enhancements beyond the original scope to show creativity and initiative.

## 🚀 Setup / Run Instructions
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
2. Place all files in a single directory (as provided).
3. Ensure the `images/` folder contains all referenced product images.
4. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (no build step required).
